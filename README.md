# Data_Project
On this project I learned how to download data sets from online sources and use them in Python for data visualization. I used two common data formats, CSV and JSON. CSV was used to process weather stored data to see the high and low temperatures in Sitka and Death Valley.  Then I used Matplotlib to make a chart based on the downloaded date to show the difference in temperatures of the two places.
The JSON file was used for earthquake data and I used Ploty to make a world map showing the locations and magnitudes of the earthquakes.

After completing this project, I was able to work with different types of data formats, and able to make complex visualizations.

Examples of the projects’ output can be found in Death Valley.png, Sitka Graph.png, and Global Earthquake.png
